# Description
In this directory we have the work necessary to generate static, historical curves for untracked WWTPs. Such curves are then to be appended to the curves regularly generated by lollipop as part of the surveillance. 

# Method
Download the full curves table from cov-spectrum and process them. Briefly:
- connect to cov-spectrum
- export table wastewater_results to csv without headers
- Open the table and remove all WWTPs that are actively tracked.
   - Filtering can also be done with
```
awk '!/Lugano \(TI\)|rich \(ZH\)|Laupen \(BE\)|Chur \(GR\)|ve \(GE\)|Basel \(BS\)/' wastewater_result.csv > wastewater_result_untracked_wwtps.csv
```
- Process the csv table to convert it to JSON

# Next steps
The generated json is supposed to be merged with the json generated weekly EXCLUSIVELY for the uploads to wisedb
